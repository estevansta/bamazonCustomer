# bamazonCustomer
Bamazon is a CLI e-commerce app that allows the customer to purchase from a set list of items from the Bamazon inventory list where the quantities interact with how many the customer decides to purchase. From there the total amount should be added up and give the customer a command line prompt where they can choose (y/n) to follow through and buy said items and to continue shopping or check out.
